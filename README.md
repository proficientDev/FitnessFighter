# FitnessFighter

## Overview of full intended application
FitnessFighter seamlessly syncs with the users smartwatch's stepcounter to earn the user "fitcoins" that can be used to purchase battle powerups, creature appearance modifications, and custom user-determined application customizations. Users can battle other users to win coins. Advanced versions hope to feature user chat, the capability of forming fighter dojos, sponsored tournaments, and links to extensive merchandise.

## minimum viable product
we intend to have an app that you log into, the user is authenticated, and then taken to a screen with their creature and current fitcoin coin count. If they've accummulated any coins since last log in, it will briefly appear as a red "+999" (or whatever the number of steps accumlated is) and then add to their total. In this screen there will be 3 options. **Option One** is to seek a battle, clicking on it will match you with someone looking for a battle, take you to a title screen for the battle (Evee vs Charmander99!) and show that X number of coins have been taken from each participant to initate the battle and then the battle happens (a set of fixed graphics, bang! zap! plod!) and the result of the battle is based off 40% player attributes and 60% randomization and then it shows who has earned the coins and then takes you back to the main screen. **Option Two** is to use your coins to powerup your creature, click on a screen, see a bar graph respresentation of your creatures current attributes and choose which you would like to boost, click on it, your bar graph ticks up and coins are subtracted, back to the main screen. **Option Three** is to log out.

## why is it valuable
Gamification and promotion of fitness, incentive for daily engagement and 'tangible' rewards.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
